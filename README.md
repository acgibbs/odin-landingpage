# odin-landingpage

Landing Page project for The Odin Project. I used flexbox for pretty much the entire page. I still am not sure the appropriate situations to use a <h> or <p> instead of a <div>. Initially I used mostly <h> and <p>, but switched at the end. I only have <h> and <p> pair left that I didn't bother to change because the container had two text lines and if I used <div>s for both then I would need to add a class for each in order to style them differently.
A lot of what was required was covered in the exercises prior to the project, so overall it was pretty straightforward.
